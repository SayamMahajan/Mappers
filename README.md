# Mappers - Real-Time Disaster Information Aggregation

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a real-time disaster information aggregation system designed to automatically collect, categorize, and display disaster-related data from various sources, including social media, news portals, and open data sources. The system leverages advanced filtering algorithms and presents the processed information on a user-friendly dashboard for disaster response agencies, enhancing situational awareness and decision-making.

## 🚀 Features
- **Real-time data aggregation** from multiple sources (social media, news, open data sources).
- **Advanced filtering algorithms** to remove noise and irrelevant information.
- **Categorization of disaster data** based on type, severity, and location.
- **Interactive dashboard** for visualization and monitoring.
- **Automated alerts** for early disaster warnings.
- **Scalable and efficient architecture** for handling large datasets.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js (or your preferred framework)
- **Backend**: Node.js/Express (or another backend technology of choice)
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Data Processing**: Python (NLP, ML models)
- **APIs & Integrations**: Twitter API, News APIs, Web Scraping (BeautifulSoup, Scrapy)
- **Hosting**: AWS/GCP
